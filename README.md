# Term Project: Implementing Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Decision Trees from Scratch

This folder contains the template notebook for the Term Project.

## Files
- `term_project.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook template (open in Google Colab)

## Overview
Implement three fundamental machine learning models from scratch using only native Python and NumPy:
1. **Linear Regression** - Predict a continuous target variable
2. **Logistic Regression** - Binary classification (one-vs-rest)
3. **Decision Trees** - Multi-class classification

All experiments use 5-fold cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning on a validation set.

## Quick Start
Right-click or Ctrl/⌘-click to open in a new tab.

## Important Rules
- **Allowed**: `sklearn` for dataset loading, cross-validation splitting, and evaluation metrics
- **Not Allowed**: `sklearn` or any library for model training/prediction (e.g., `LinearRegression`, `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`)
- **Not Allowed**: Libraries for grid search (e.g., `GridSearchCV`)
- Models must be implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy
